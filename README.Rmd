The goal of {emojiscape} is whimsy.

It prints to the console a randomised scene composed of emoji. Each terrain type has three emoji that are sampled with provided probabilities (common, uncommon and rare).

Install {emojiscape} from GitHub. Requires [the GitHub-hosted {emo} package](https://github.com/hadley/emo).

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/emojiscape")
```

Then `generate()` a scene. 

Here's an `ocean`.

```{r ocean}
emojiscape::generate(terrain = "ocean")
```

Here's a `city`.

```{r city}
emojiscape::generate(terrain = "city")
```

Here's a `desert`.

```{r desert}
emojiscape::generate(terrain = "desert")
```
